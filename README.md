# Operation-Analytics-and-Investigating-Metric-Spike

Operation Analytics is the analysis done for the complete end to end operations of a company. With the help of this, the company then finds the areas on which it must improve upon. You work closely with the ops team, support team, marketing team, etc and help them derive insights out of the data they collect.

Being one of the most important parts of a company, this kind of analysis is further used to predict the overall growth or decline of a company’s fortune. It means better automation, better understanding between cross-functional teams, and more effective workflows.

Why have sales taken a dip? Etc. Questions like these must be answered daily and for that its very important to investigate metric spike.

business on the proper track? Etc. A company may get a proper understanding about what is
the current state of its sales, if any loss what measures can be taken to overcome such
conditions, operational analytics is a more specific term for a type of business analytics that
focuses on improving existing operations.
